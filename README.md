# Analytics-Dashboard-for-Visualization-of-KPI-and-Other-Metrics
An analytics dashboard is a data visualization tool that aggregates, displays, and analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and other key data points related to a business, department, or specific process.

To build an analytics dashboard using Python, we can use the plotly dash framework. Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytical applications. Itâ€™s built on top of Plotly.js and React.js.

It offers a simple interface for creating interactive, web-based dashboards. It is highly customizable and can produce very sophisticated and interactive dashboards. Dash applications are web servers running Flask and communicating JSON packets over HTTP requests.
